# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
For this Project we are helping Seth and Tom to successfully submit the election audit results.The election commission requested some additional data to complete the audit:

1) The voter turnout for each county
2) The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
3) The county with the highest turnout

## Resources
Data Source: election_results.csv

## Software: 

Python 3.9.5, Visual Studio Code 1.58.0

## Summary
As per the analysis of the election, it shows that:

The Total Votes were 369,711.

The candidates were:
- Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
- Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
- Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)

The candidate results were as follows:
- Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the votes and the total of 85,213 votes.
- Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the votes and the total of 272,892 votes.
- Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the votes and the total of 11,606 votes.

The results of the election:

Diana DeGette won the election and she received 272,892 number of votes and 73.8% of the total votes in the election.

## Challenge Overview

We are helping Seth to complete an election audit of the recent election.

We provided Seth and Tom the findings of the following tasks as follows:

1. Calculate the total number of votes. 
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes. 
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received. 
4. Calculated the percentage of votes of each cadidate.
5. The Winner of the election as per the maximum votes.

The findings of the following tasks were added to the final election audit:

1) The voter turnout for each county
2) The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
3) The county with the highest turnout

## Challenge Summary
This script can be used for any election and we can modify the code.
For example if we would like to find the lowest votes for a county.
We can do that by modifying the following code to loosing count.

Determine winning vote count, winning percentage, and candidate.
        if (votes > winning_count) and (vote_percentage > winning_percentage):
            winning_count = votes
            winning_candidate = candidate_name
            winning_percentage = vote_percentage
